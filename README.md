# Councilmembers-persistence-in-Finland
Persistence of councilmembers elected in 2004 local elections in Finland. An analysis using Python Lifelines module.

This is a project of my own interest. I did the analysis to learn to use Python Lifelines module, and in general, to conduct survival analysis.

I gathered the data from Statistics Finland (Tilastokeskus) besides name data, which I attained from Digital and Population Data Services Agency (Digi- ja väestötietovirasto). All data used in this analysis is public.

The code is mine. However, I have used Stackoverflow, lifelines and pandas documentation, and other sources to a great extent to learn to do the analysis. I also thank my ex-colleague Janne Lehtonen for sharing his thoughts (he has done survival analysis).

For further questions about the data or analysis, please contact me in LinkedIn or via email (johannes.niemelainen@gmail.com).
